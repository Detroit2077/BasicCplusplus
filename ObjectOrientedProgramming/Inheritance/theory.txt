Inheritance in C++

1. The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance
2. We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inherititing from it 
3. The existing class is called as the Base Class
4. The new class which  is Inheritance is called as the Derived class
5. Reusing classes saves time and money.
6. There are different types of inheritance in C++.



1. Single  Inheritance

When a class is derived from a single base class.

2. Multiple Inheritance

When a class is derived from more than one Base class.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance 

Several deriveed classes from a single base class.

4.Multilevel Inheritance

Deriving a class from already derived class.

5. Hybrid Inheritance

It is the combination of multiple, multilevel and hierarchical inheritance.
